### Bounty Specification: Implement a Nostr Wallet Connect Funding Source for LNbits

#### **Project Overview**

This project involves the development of a funding source within LNbits that can use a remote NWC wallet service.

#### **Objective**

To create a NWC funding source for LNbits that allows for lightning network operations using a remote Nostr Wallet Connect wallet service. This funding source should implement all funding source functions using NWC as defined in the Void funding source stub - https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/blob/dev/lnbits/wallets/void.py

#### **Deliverables**

1. **NWC Funding Source**: Robust funding source for LNbits that implements all funding source functions using NIP-47.
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide including:
    - Installation and configuration processes.
    - Configuration guidelines to connect with various NWC wallet services.
3. **Test Suite**: Complete set of tests ensuring the functionality works under various scenarios and adheres to the NIP-47 protocol.
4. **Demonstration**: A working demonstration of LNbits acting as a NWC client, performing transactions using a NWC wallet service.

#### **Technology Requirements**

- The extension should be implemented in Python to align with the existing LNbits platform.
- Follow the NIP-47 protocol.
- Integration should support asynchronous operations to handle real-time transaction confirmations.
#### **Budget**

- **Total Bounty**: XXXXXX sats
- Payments will be released in phases:
    - 30% after approval of the prototype.
    - 70% upon final delivery, after successful testing and documentation review.

#### **Evaluation Criteria**

- Adherence to the NIP-47 specifications and LNbits integration requirements.
- Security and efficiency of the implementation.
- Quality of documentation and ease of use.
